# ==================== OPTIMIZED SOLUTION - in real life ===========================
"""
- Fewer Operations: Direct removal of LRU page from the set avoids rearranging the entire deque.
- Scalability: Deque operations depend on shifting elements, set and dict approach becomes favorable for large dataset
- Memory Management: The set and dict implementation ensures better handling of the LRU logic without redundant operations, critical for performance-sensitive applications.
